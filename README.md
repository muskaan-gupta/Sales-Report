# 📊 Sales Report Dashboard – Power BI

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project presents an **interactive Sales Report Dashboard** built using **Power BI**.  
The goal is to analyze sales performance, track revenue trends, monitor churn, and provide actionable insights for better business decision-making.  

The dashboard combines **data visualization** with **DAX measures** to deliver a clear and interactive view of key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Approach / What You Did

I started by collecting and preparing the dataset, which required cleaning and shaping the data.
Then, I designed the data model in Power BI and created custom DAX measures — for example, calculating churn rate, revenue growth %, and customer retention.
To enhance interactivity, I added filters, slicers, and drill-down options, so users could analyze sales by region, time, and product category.
I also explored how SQL queries could be used for preprocessing data and how Python (Pandas & Seaborn) can complement Power BI by doing deeper exploratory analysis before visualization.

## Key Learnings

Through this project, I learned how to:

Structure and model data efficiently in Power BI.

Use DAX functions for dynamic calculations.

Apply SQL and Python alongside Power BI for a complete analytics workflow.

Design dashboards that are not only visually appealing but also easy for non-technical users to understand.

- **Advanced SQL Queries** – Use optimized SQL scripts for complex joins, aggregations, and transformations before loading data into Power BI.  
- **Python Integration** – Leverage Python scripts in Power BI for advanced data cleaning, statistical analysis, and machine learning-based forecasting.  
- **Drill-Through & Drill-Down Features** – Allow users to explore sales data at multiple levels (region → state → city → product).  
- **Predictive Analytics** – Apply machine learning models (using Python/R) to forecast revenue, detect anomalies, and analyze churn patterns.  
- **Role-Based Dashboards** – Create customized views for Sales Managers, Finance teams, and Executives.  
- **Mobile Optimization** – Design mobile-friendly layouts to make dashboards accessible on phones and tablets.  
- **Export & Sharing Options** – Enable export to PDF, Excel, and embed reports into web apps for broader accessibility.
